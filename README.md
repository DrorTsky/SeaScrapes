# SeaScrapes

This is my personal web scraper that collects information about the sea from three different sites.
I needed a way to easily collect this information since I always needed to alter between those sites
before going surfing or diving.

the scraping is done using Beautiful Soup 4 in the Python utils.py file.
I've used django in-order to allow my progressive web application access to the information.
